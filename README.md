# Jacob's Dotfile Repo

Here's where I version control my dotfiles. Feel free to copy/fork/borrow. Reading through these files will give you an idea as to my typical workflow. In some of the longer dotfiles I have use markings for vim folding. If you view these files with vim (compiled with `+folding`), the files are more easily browsed.

## Vim
Vim :heart: is my editor of choice. Contained in my vimrc is a list of settings, mappings, plugins, etc.

## R
R is my go to analysis tool, and I have a few settings defined in Rprofile.
